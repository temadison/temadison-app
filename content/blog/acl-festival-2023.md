Our family loves going to see live music and that has been one of the best things about moving to Austin.

Here we are at the ACL (Austin City Limits, for those not in the know) Festival 2023 in front of the Honda stage.

Below are a few pics from the 3-day event (which this year happened to fall on the Saturday where there was an "annular" eclipse -- not quite full here in Austin -- one of the pics shows the cool shadows that were cast during that eclipse).

Some of the bands that we saw included Portugal. The Man, Alanis Morissette, Dope Lemon, The Breeders, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs (see pics below). Other acts, not featured in the gallery but ones I thoroughly enjoyed were the Foo Fighters, Declan McKenna, Hozier, Yves Tumor, Tegan and Sara, Goodnight Texas, and Rattlesnake Milk.
